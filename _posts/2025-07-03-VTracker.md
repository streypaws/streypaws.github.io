description: A Tool to keep track of Chrome Releases and automtically point out V8 commits using Bug ID.

## Motivation

Staying up to date with the latest bugs/N-Days in [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home/) is crucial (and exciting!), but the process can be quite tedious. Typically, one has to navigate to the `Chrome Releases` blog for a specific month, locate the `Stable Desktop Release` post, dig into the linked git logs, and manually trace each bug. If the bug is related to [V8](https://v8.dev/), the process becomes even more complex, requiring additional investigation across separate V8 git logs. Identifying the exact commit corresponding to a specific `Bug ID` is time-consuming and can often lead to confusion or oversight.

I wanted a tool that could automate this entire process: extract bugs, match them to commits, and display both the bug description and the relevant commit... automatically. That’s why I built `VTracker`. 

Inspired by [@ret2happy](https://x.com/ret2happy)’s excellent [BugsAggregator](https://x.com/BugsAggregator), which provides a similar aggregation for recent Chromium bugs, I set out to create a streamlined tool focused on newly released issues—especially those still marked as restricted in the Chromium issue tracker.

## Implementation

`VTracker` automates the same process a security researcher would manually follow. It begins by fetching posts from the `Chrome Releases` blog, specifically aggregating all advisory links under `Stable Releases for Desktop`, which is typically posted by Google one to thrice  per month. From these advisories, it extracts detailed vulnerability information, including all relevant `Bug IDs`.

The critical next step is to correlate these `Bug IDs` with corresponding commits in the Chromium Git logs, and, when applicable, the V8 Git logs (for V8-related issues). Once this mapping is complete, the tool presents the matched information in a clean, structured format.

This allows researchers to instantly view the bugs disclosed in a specific month (or the most recent one), along with the exact commits where those bugs were fixed—eliminating the need to manually sift through extensive commit logs. As a result, researchers can focus directly on analyzing the patch diffs and understanding the root cause, in a much more efficient and streamlined way.

## Usage

First `git clone` the repository and inside it, create a python `virtual environment`

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
{: .nolineno }

Then install the requirements using this command 

```bash
pip3 install requests termcolor bs4
```
{: .nolineno }

After which you may run the script using - 

```bash
python3 app.py --help
```
{: .nolineno }

If everything goes correctly, you'll be greeted by this menu -

Just supply the `--year` (between 2009-current year) and `--month` (value between 1-12), and you're good to go!

Example -
```bash
python3 app.py --year 2024 --month 10 # Fetches the Chrome Release for 2024/10
```

## Case Study

Although `VTracker` is nothing but a result of sheer automation, the real question is: does it really work? To find out, I’ll walk through a case study (or just a test-drive) on the latest Chrome Release (2025/06) to check if our tool automatically fetches the information and tags the corresponding Git commits correctly.

We'll run the command -
```bash
python3 app.py --year 2025 --month 6 # Fetches the Chrome Release for 2025/06
```

and observe the results -

At the outset, `VTracker` scans the `Chrome Releases` page to identify up to three separate entries for `Stable Releases for Desktop`, each associated with a specific release date. These entries may contain important vulnerability information relevant to recent updates.

The tool then parses each advisory link individually to extract detailed vulnerability information. Using the `Git logs`, it matches each `Bug ID` to its corresponding commit, effectively identifying the exact change where the bug was fixed. This process is demonstrated clearly in the case of `CVE-2025-6192`, where the tool correctly identifies the fix commit as `a41716a9f6074a035d4ccd247844b021b0bce090`. This mapping can be manually verified by following the associated links and confirming the `Bug ID` in the commit message.

![Desktop View](/assets/Browser/Tools/VTracker/confirm2.png){: width="900" height="650" }

For V8-related bugs, `VTracker` performs an additional step by locating `V8 commit links` within the `Chromium Git Logs`. It then visits each link and identifies the specific V8 commit that corresponds to the `Bug ID`, ensuring accurate mapping for V8 fixes.

![Desktop View](/assets/Browser/Tools/VTracker/output2.png){: width="1000" height="750" }

This is clearly demonstrated above with the V8 bug `CVE-2025-6554`, which was recently reported and fixed. `VTracker` accurately identifies the fix commit as `069790710f28b00ff8d7b4c665eef6b4eb8768f6`. This mapping can be manually verified by reviewing the linked commit and confirming the presence of the corresponding `Bug ID` in the commit message.

![Desktop View](/assets/Browser/Tools/VTracker/confirm3.png){: width="550" height="350" }
![Desktop View](/assets/Browser/Tools/VTracker/confirm4.png){: width="900" height="650" }

In this way, `VTracker` enables quick extraction of all recent bugs for a given month directly from the Chrome Releases blog, with accurate mapping of each bug to its corresponding fix commit. This eliminates the tedious and time-consuming task of manually searching through Git logs, allowing researchers to focus their efforts on root cause analysis and patch review—rather than wasting time trying to "find Waldo" in a sea of commits.

If you wish to try out `VTracker`, you can find it on my [Github](https://github.com/Shreyas-Penkar/VTracker).

`Linux (x86_64)`, `Windows`, `MacOS` all are supported.
