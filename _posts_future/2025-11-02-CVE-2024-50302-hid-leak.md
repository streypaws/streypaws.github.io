Understanding the Android kernel is essential for anyone working in security research, systems programming, or OS development. As the core of the platform, the kernel mediates hardware access, process scheduling, and security boundaries. Building and running the kernel under emulation gives researchers a safe, reproducible environment to inspect internals, trace execution paths, and analyze the impact of vulnerabilities without risking real devices.

Adding USB support in QEMU and using USB redirection (using usbredir) extends that environment to hardware-facing subsystems like USB and HID, enabling realistic testing of drivers and USB-dependent attack surfaces. Combined with robust debugging (kernel symbols, GDB, KGDB, and tracing), this workflow makes it possible to reproduce complex USB/HID bugs, step through kernel code, and validate mitigations. Ultimately, it deepens understanding and improves our ability to find and fix security issues in different USB drivers and stacks before they reach production.

## Overview



## Conclusion

Studying the Android kernel through compilation, emulation, and debugging offers a practical path to understanding the core of the operating system. By setting up a reproducible environment using QEMU, we create a safe and flexible platform for kernel experimentation — from exploring internals and developing drivers to analyzing real-world vulnerabilities. Extending this setup with USB support and redirection using usbredir brings hardware-facing subsystems into the mix, enabling realistic testing of USB drivers and attack surfaces. When combined with advanced debugging tools like GDB, KGDB, and kernel tracing, this workflow allows step-by-step analysis of complex bugs, validation of mitigations, and in-depth study of kernel behavior.
