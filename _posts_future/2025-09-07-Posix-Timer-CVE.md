In this blog, I'll be presenting my research on `CVE-2025-38352` (a `posix-cpu-timers` race) covering the patch analysis, vulnerability analysis, and insights into my process of developing a PoC that caused a crash in the Android kernel. It was released in the [September 2025 Android Bulletin](https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2025-09-01), marked as possibly under limited, targeted exploitation.
